Data from the FAO for demonstrating reading and merging datasets, to give some more practice to things learned in week three of Getting and Cleaning Data.

The plan is people can fork this repo, and try and clean up the data in it using techniques seen in week 3. You could also browse other peoples forks to see how they did it.


As per the terms and conditions on the FAO website <http://www.fao.org/contact-us/terms/en/> I am acknowledging the source of the data in order to be able to freely use it.

_Except where otherwise indicated, content may be copied, printed and downloaded for private study, research and teaching purposes, or for use in non-commercial products or services, provided that appropriate acknowledgement of FAO as the source and copyright holder is given and that FAO's endorsement of users' views, products or services is not stated or implied in any way._
